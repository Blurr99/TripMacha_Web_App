## Introduction

Traveling is a wonderful experience that broadens our horizons and allows us to create lasting memories. The Trip website is an online platform that simplifies the process of planning and organizing trips. Users can explore various travel destinations, read travel guides, and connect with fellow travelers. Whether you're a solo adventurer or a group of friends looking for an exciting vacation, Trip has got you covered!

This repository contains the source code for the Trip website. It includes the front-end and back-end components necessary to run the website and provide users with a seamless travel planning experience.

## Figma Design

To view the visual design and layout of the Trip website, we have used Figma. Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that allows us to create and share design mockups efficiently.

You can access the Figma design by clicking on the following link: [Figma Design](<FIGMA_LINK>).

## Wireframe

Wireframes are low-fidelity sketches that help us plan and visualize the basic structure and layout of the website before diving into detailed design and development.
